# Tauri Integration Progress Tracker

*Last Updated: July 8, 2025*

## 🎯 **Project Goal**
Create a self-contained desktop application for Script to Speech TTS Playground that automatically manages the FastAPI backend and provides a professional user experience for non-technical users.

## 📊 **Overall Progress: 75% Complete**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Web Application Foundation** (100% Complete)

  - Dynamic configuration forms based on provider introspection
  
- [x] **React Frontend Development**
  - Professional TTS Playground interface
  - Provider selection with dynamic configuration
  - Voice library browser with preview
  - Real-time audio generation and playback
  - Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

- [x] **Integration Testing**
  - Web application fully functional
  - All TTS providers working (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Minimax, Zonos)
  - Audio generation and download working
  - Cross-browser compatibility verified

### ✅ **Phase 2: Tauri Desktop Framework** (100% Complete)
- [x] **Tauri 2.0 Setup**
  - Project initialization with proper configuration
  - React frontend integration
  - TypeScript and Tailwind CSS compatibility
  - Build system configuration

- [x] **Desktop Application Architecture**
  - Native window management
  - React frontend embedded in Tauri
  - Rust backend for system integration
  - Cross-platform configuration (macOS, Windows, Linux)

- [x] **Basic Build Pipeline**
  - Debug builds working
  - DMG installer creation
  - App bundle generation
  - Development environment setup

### 🔄 **Phase 3: Backend Integration** (80% Complete)
- [x] **Automatic Backend Startup**
  - Rust code to spawn FastAPI process
  - Backend lifecycle management (start/stop)
  - Error handling and process monitoring
  - Backend status UI component

- [x] **Development Mode Integration**
  - Backend auto-start on app launch
  - Clean shutdown on app close
  - Debug output and error logging
  - React component for backend status

- ⚠️ **Production Build Issues** (Identified & Solution Planned)
  - Current fragile path resolution (`"../../../"`)
  - External dependency on uv/Python installation
  - Not truly self-contained for end users
  - **Solution**: Bundle backend as executable (in progress)

### 🚧 **Phase 4: Self-Contained Executable** (In Progress - 30% Complete)
- [ ] **Package Restructure** (Next: In Progress)
  - Merge GUI backend into main package structure
  - Use standard Python packaging with optional dependencies
  - Preserve git history with proper `git mv` operations
  - Update import statements and dependencies

- [ ] **PyInstaller Integration** (Pending)
  - Add PyInstaller as build dependency
  - Create standalone backend executable
  - Test executable functionality
  - Integrate with uv build system

- [ ] **Tauri Bundle Configuration** (Pending)
  - Configure Tauri to bundle backend executable
  - Update Rust code to use bundled executable
  - Remove external path dependencies
  - Test self-contained functionality

### 🎯 **Phase 5: Production Ready** (Pending - 0% Complete)
- [ ] **Complete Build Pipeline**
  - Automated build script for complete app
  - Backend executable + Tauri app creation
  - Cross-platform build testing
  - CI/CD pipeline setup

- [ ] **Distribution Preparation**
  - Code signing configuration
  - Installer creation and testing
  - App store preparation (if desired)
  - Documentation for end users

- [ ] **Quality Assurance**
  - Performance optimization
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Startup time optimization
  - Error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 **Current Technical Architecture**

### **Working Components**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with real TTS provider integration
- **Desktop**: Tauri 2.0 with Rust process management
- **Build**: Debug builds creating functional desktop apps

### **Integration Points**
- **React ↔ Tauri**: Tauri API calls for backend management
- **Tauri ↔ FastAPI**: Process spawning and lifecycle management
- **FastAPI ↔ TTS**: Real provider integration and audio generation

### **Known Issues & Solutions**
1. **Path Resolution** (Critical)
   - Issue: Hardcoded `"../../../"` path doesn't work in production
   - Solution: Bundle backend as executable, use Tauri resource paths

2. **External Dependencies** (Critical)
   - Issue: Requires uv/Python on user's system
   - Solution: PyInstaller to create standalone backend executable

3. **Package Structure** (High Priority)
   - Issue: Two separate Python packages complicate builds
   - Solution: Merge into single package with optional dependencies

## 📝 **Next Immediate Steps**

### **Step 1: Package Restructure** (This Week)
1. Execute git mv operations to merge packages
2. Update pyproject.toml configuration
3. Fix import statements in moved files
4. Test unified package functionality

### **Step 2: PyInstaller Integration** (This Week)
1. Add PyInstaller as build dependency
2. Create build script for backend executable
3. Test standalone executable creation
4. Verify all TTS providers work in bundled form

### **Step 3: Tauri Bundle Update** (This Week)
1. Configure Tauri to bundle backend executable
2. Update Rust code to use bundled executable path
3. Test complete self-contained application
4. Verify installation and execution on clean systems

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**
