# TTS Playground GUI Test Instructions

## üöÄ **Current Status**

### ‚úÖ **Completed Components**
- **FastAPI Backend** with full REST API
- **React Frontend** with modern UI components
- **Dynamic form generation** based on provider capabilities
- **Voice library integration** with preview support
- **Real-time task tracking** and status updates
- **Audio playback** with built-in controls

### üß™ **Testing the Implementation**

#### **Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)**
```bash
# One command to start both servers
./gui/start_test.sh
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Testing**
For testing the frontend without STS dependencies:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start mock backend
cd gui/backend
uv run python test_server.py

# Terminal 2: Start frontend  
cd gui/frontend
npm run dev
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed Issues:**
- Updated Tailwind CSS PostCSS configuration
- Fixed TypeScript import issues with `type` imports
- Resolved async audio playback errors
- Fixed API method return types

**Mock Backend Features:**
- ‚úÖ Provider introspection (OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- ‚úÖ Voice library with sample voices
- ‚úÖ Configuration validation
- ‚úÖ Simulated audio generation with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ CORS enabled for frontend connection

#### **Option 2: Full Backend (When Dependencies Fixed)**
Once Python 3.13 compatibility issues are resolved:

```bash
# Start full backend with real STS integration
cd gui/backend
uv run sts-gui-server

# Frontend (same as above)
cd gui/frontend
npm run dev
```

### üéØ **What You Can Test**

1. **Provider Selection**
   - Dropdown shows available TTS providers
   - Provider info displays with field requirements

2. **Voice Library Browser**
   - Browse voices by provider
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Audio preview buttons (mock URLs)
   - Automatic config population

3. **Dynamic Configuration Forms**
   - Forms auto-generate based on provider requirements
   - Real-time validation with error messages
   - Support for all field types (string, number, boolean, list, object)

4. **Text-to-Speech Generation**
   - Text input with character count
   - Generation button with loading states
   - Real-time progress tracking

5. **Audio Management**
   - Built-in audio player with controls
   - Download functionality
   - Task status monitoring

### üé® **UI Features**

- **Modern Design**: Tailwind CSS with clean, professional styling
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status monitoring and progress bars
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and validation
- **Connection Monitoring**: Shows backend connection status

### üì± **Screenshots Reference**

The UI design follows the aesthetic of the provider playgrounds you shared:
- **Clean header** with app title and connection status
- **Left panel** for configuration (text input, provider, voice, settings)
- **Right panel** for status and results (generation status, audio player)
- **Card-based layout** with consistent spacing and shadows

### üîß **Next Steps**

1. **Test Frontend Functionality**: Use the mock backend to verify all UI components work
2. **Fix Python Dependencies**: Resolve Python 3.13 compatibility for full backend
3. **Tauri Integration**: Wrap the React app in Tauri 2.0 for desktop functionality
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Test with real TTS providers once backend is working

### üìä **Current Implementation**

- **Backend**: ~90% complete (blocked by Python 3.13 issues)
- **Frontend**: ~95% complete (may need minor fixes after testing)
- **Integration**: Ready for testing with mock data
- **Tauri**: Not yet started (next phase)

The implementation provides a solid foundation for a professional TTS playground that matches the functionality shown in your screenshots while adding the unique features of the Script-to-Speech system (multiple providers, voice library, etc.).
